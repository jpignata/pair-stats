# pair-stats

At a glance statistics from your git repository showing with whom you've paired recently.

The days column shows the number of unique days you've had a check-in with the other author, commits shows the number of individual repository commits made and % uses days to illustrate how often you've paired with the other author.

Commits made without a pair are grouped under "Solo."

This assumes your commit authors are developers names joined with "and", an ampersand and/or a comma.

## Usage:

    Options:  -d, --days,  the number of days you would like to analyze.  Default: 30 days
